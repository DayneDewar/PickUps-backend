The defensive team can then try and block or return the ball again hitting it a maximum of three times. Games are played up to 25 points and must be won by 2 clear points. Violations will be called for the following: 1. Stepping over the base line when serving the ball. 2. Ball hits the net and fails to get over the net (If the ball hits the net and still goes over the net then this is perfectly legal). 3. Players are not allowed to carry, palm or run with the ball. 4.

Once a player puts two hands on the ball (not including catching the ball) they cannot then dribble or move with the ball and the ball must be passed or shot. After the ball goes into a team’s half and they win possession back the ball must then make it back over the half way line within 10 seconds. If the ball fails to do so then a foul will be called and the ball will be turned over. Each team has 24 seconds to at least shot at the basket. A shot constitutes either going in the basket or hitting the rim of the basket. If after the shot is taken and the ball fails to go in the basket then the shot clock is restarted for another 24 seconds. The team trying to score a basket is called the offence whilst the team trying to prevent them from scoring is called the defence. The defence must do all they can to stop the offence from scoring by either blocking a shot or preventing a shot from being fired.

A 2 minute break between the 1st & 2nd and 3rd & 4th quarters is had along with a 15 minute rest between 2nd and 3rd quarters (half time). Each team has 4 downs to gain 10 or more yards. They can either throw or run the ball to make the yards. As soon as the team gains the required yards then the downs reset and the yardage resets. Failure to make the yardage after 4 downs will result in a turnover. There are hundreds of different plays that players can run on any down. Plays are made up by the teams and often have players running all over the place (routes) in what is essentially organised chaos. The head coach or quarter back calls the on field plays for the attacking team whilst the defensive captain calls the plays for the defensive team. At the start of every game is the coin toss to decide which team receives the ball first and which side of the pitch they want to start from. The game begins with a kick-off where one team punts the ball down field for the other team to then run back with the ball as far as possible. On fourth down the offence has the option to either try to make up the yards they are short or to kick the ball. If they decide to kick they have two options; to punt or to try for a field goal. Depending on their position on the pitch will usually dictate their paly. Anything within 40 yards or so of the opposition’s goal posts will result in a field goal attempt. Further back will likely mean they take the punt option.", image: "https://sports.nbcsports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/GettyImages-1188526707.jpg", user_id: 1)

Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match. The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds, two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible. The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape. Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player. Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It’s the assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team and also assist the referee in all decision making processes where appropriate. If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes. If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place. The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal. For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced. If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.", image: "https://bcrams.com/images/2018/10/1/Soccer_picture.jpg", user_id: 1)

The fielding team’s positions are made up of a pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, third baseman, and three outfielders at left field, centre field and right field. Games last for 9 innings of which both teams get to bat once. If the game is a tie after 9 innings then an extra inning will be added until a winner is found. If the team batting second in the bottom of the 9th inning are already ahead in points, then they do not need to complete their batting innings. Once a batting order is picked, then it cannot be changed throughout the game. Substitutes are permitted, however, they must bat in the order of the previous player whom they replaced. If the batter manages to hit the ball from the pitcher, they must make an effort to at least get to first base. They can then run to as many bases as they wish before being tagged out. Each base must be touched with some part of the batters body when running past. A batter gets up to three strikes before getting out. A strike is deemed when a batter swings for a ball and misses it. The batter can leave the ball but, if it’s within a certain area (called the 'strike zone'), then a strike will also be given. If four balls miss the strike zone and the batter does not swing their bat, they can walk to first base. When on base, the batter can run to the next base at any point. Players can be dismissed by either a 'strike out' (referring to a batsman missing the ball three times), 'force out' (when a player fails to make the base before the defensive player), 'fly out' (when the ball is hit in the air and caught without it bouncing), and 'tag outs' (where a defensive player with the ball tags the batsman with the ball all whilst they are running).

Because Kickball is usually played in school sports sessions, then team sizes can vary, although WAKA recommends teams should be between 8 and 11.

If they cannot return the serve then the serving team gets a point. Each team is allowed up to 3 touches in order to return the ball into the net. It is not required that you hit the ball all 3 times. Each time the ball hits the net possession switches to the other team. The rally or volley continues until one team cannot return the ball into the net. Spikeball uses rally scoring, so points can be won by either team regardless of who is serving.

Body checking can be used but is not prohibited in the back or above shoulder height. Players who are imposed to have committed a minor penalty will be ordered to leave the ice for two minutes and their team play with 5 players for that duration. If the opposing team score a goal within those two minutes then that player can return to the rink immediately. A minor penalty can include tripping an opponent with their stick, holding with either their stick or hands, hooking with their stick or body checking a player without the puck. Major penalties will result in a player being removed from the ice for up to 5 minutes. These may include fighting, inflicting serious injury on opposing players or continued minor violations.

With the exception of the knight, a piece may not move over or through any of the other pieces. When a king is threatened with capture (but can protect himself or escape), it´s called check. If a king is in check, then the player must make a move that eliminates the threat of capture and cannot leave the king in check.

The server must then serve each point from alternative sides on the base line. At no point must the server’s feet move in front of the baseline on the court prior to hitting their serve. If the server fails to get their first serve in they may take advantage of a second serve. If they again fail to get their second serve in then a double fault will be called and the point lost. If the server clips the net but the ball goes in the service area still then let is called and they get to take that serve again without penalty. If the ball hits the net and fails to go in the service area then out is called and they lose that serve. The receiver may stand where they wish upon receipt of the serve. If the ball is struck without the serve bouncing then the server will receive the point. Once a serve has been made the amount of shots between the players can be unlimited. The point is won by hitting the ball so the opponent fails to return it in the scoring areas. Points are awarded in scores of 15, 30 and 40. 15 represent 1 point, 30 = 2 and 40 = 3.
